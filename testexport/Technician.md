The Technician is the first science minion you will have.They use the
laboratory bench to train one another. They can also perform basic tasks
such as monitering an x-ray machine.Finally the technicians are horrible
in fights,they will not get involved unless forced too.

The techinician like all other minions are used in AOI.The Techinicians
have a special in the world map which makes the task of acquiring loot
or gaining a peice of technology a little bit shorter.Techincians also
repair objects in your base.The technician has the capability to
research but is much slower than other types of science minions.
