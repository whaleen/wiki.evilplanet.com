If the [Forces of Justice](/Forces_of_Justice "wikilink") are being
especially troublesome you can always put your base on alert. There are
three main types of alert:

Green Alert
-----------

If your base is set to Green Alert your minions will disarm themselves
and behave normally. Use green alert during periods of low
[heat](/Heat "wikilink").

Yellow Alert
------------

If your base is set to Yellow Alert, minions will go to the
[Armory](/Armory "wikilink") to arm themselves. Yellow alert is most
commonly used if there are potentially dangerous
[agents](/Agents "wikilink") on the island.

Red Alert
---------

If you set your base to Red Alert your minions will arm themselves and
run around the island, attacking any and all
[agents](/Agents "wikilink") they encounter. This should be used in
emergencies or when your base is under attack by a troublesome group of
soldiers.
