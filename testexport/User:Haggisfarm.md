Well, i'm Haggisfarm, i'm the original thinker-upper of the Evil Planet
wiki, and saddly, much to my dismay, i've yet to be rewarded... I had
originally hoped that it'd be called WikiGenius, but i guess that didn't
happen because as you can see right there in the normal skin, it's the
Evil Planet Wiki. \<-----

so, yeah, i'm a genius, yet to get credit for his great idea...

SNAKES ON A PLANE MAN! SNAKES ON A FREAKIN PLANE!
