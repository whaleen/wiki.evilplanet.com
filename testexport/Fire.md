Fire is a nasty thing that may erupt at the worst of times in your quest
to rule the world. Fires can be started in three main ways: \[\*\]
[Agents](/Agents "wikilink") \[\*\] [Super
Agents](/Super_Agents "wikilink") \[\*\] Normal wear on objects
[Agents](/Agents "wikilink") and [Super
Agents](/Super_Agents "wikilink") [Saboutage](/Saboutage "wikilink") the
base with carefully set bombs, which do much damage in the way of an
explosion. the explosion will set many of your nearby objects on fire,
many times destroying the ones closest. Also, when you are kept under a
state of much power usage without more then one [Electrical Power
Generator](/Electrical_Power_Generator "wikilink") or [Nuclear Power
Generator](/Nuclear_Power_Generator "wikilink"), The existing generators
may explode, causing in the same way as the bombs, catestropic damage.

Fire can only be contained by the use of a [Fire
Extinguisher](/Fire_Extinguisher "wikilink") utilized by a
[Valetand](/Valet "wikilink") Fire Damage can only be repaired with the
use of a [Technicianor](/Technician "wikilink") replacement of the
object using a [Construction Worker](/Construction_Worker "wikilink") or
[Valet](/Valet "wikilink")
