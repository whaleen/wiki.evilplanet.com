Objectives, which can be optional or required, are tasks which you need
to fulfill in order to progress in and finally complete [Evil
Genius](/Evil_Genius "wikilink").

There are ten required objectives, details of which can be found below.
These are generally split into two or three sub-objectives, and can take
anywhere between 15 minutes and several hours to complete. It is through
these objectives that vital [loot](/loot "wikilink") is found, new
[trainers](/trainers "wikilink") are kidnapped and your path to world
domination is sought.

Optional objectives appear occasionally throughout the game to afford
you the opportunity to collect rare pieces of [loot](/loot "wikilink")
and get rid of pesky super agents.
