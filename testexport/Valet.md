The valet is an important and (compared to other strategy games)
interesting change from normal characters. The first in the "social"
group of minions, this guy is a useful help when moving and placing
items, collecting cash and is the only minion that can fight fires (and
that includes higher level social minions). Another job is picking up
incapacitated characters and taking them to the barracks. He can also do
various jobs that all minions will do, such as working in the control
room or the mess hall.

Like other social minions, the valet is also useful for performing
social attacks on agents, leaving them confused and can lead to agents
forgetting where they have been or what they have seen. They are,
however, nowhere near as good at this than the higher-level minions.
