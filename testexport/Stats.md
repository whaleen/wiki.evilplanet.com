Everyone has stats, including [minions](/minions "wikilink"),
[agents](/agents "wikilink"), [henchmen](/henchmen "wikilink"), and even
[your evil self](/Evil_Geniuses "wikilink"). The five main stats are:

Health
------

A numerical measure of how healthy you are. If this reaches zero, it's
bodybag time.

Loyalty
-------

Minions and Agents aren't robots, and they too can become dissatisfied
with their jobs. If an agent's loyalty reaches zero, he will wander
around like a tourist until he/she leaves. If a minion's loyalty becomes
zero, he will defect. Henchmen and the Evil Genius do not lose loyalty.

Attention
---------

Ever feel like you just can't concentrate? Try drinking a soda to
replenish your attention (odd, but it works). If an Agent has low
attention he/she is less prone to [heat](/heat "wikilink") gain and will
forget where he/she has been. If minions or henchmen have low attention
they will trigger any traps they come across.

Smarts
------

You get dumber over time, I guess. When an agent's smarts reaches zero
he will forget what he has seen and lose all [heat](/heat "wikilink").
If a minion's smarts reaches zero he will stand there in a stupor
(minions aren't the brightest - but that's where you come in).

Endeurance
----------

You can only keep ticking for a limited time. Eventually, you're just
going to crash. If anyone's endeurance reaches zero they will fall to
the floor unconcious.
