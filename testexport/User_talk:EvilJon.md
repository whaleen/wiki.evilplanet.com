Jon, I can see what you've tried to do with the minion Weaken stats
boxes. It's a good idea, to make individual pages for each of the stats.
Should we break the existing [stats](/stats "wikilink") page up into
separate pages for each stat to allow this? Or should we redirect all
those via piped links to the general stats page (eg.
[Loyalty](/stats "wikilink"))?

What does everyone think?

(Appologies for hijacking your talk page for this, by the way)
