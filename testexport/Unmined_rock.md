Unmined rock is what your base is made of before you start building into
it. You base is set into a mountain, which the unmined rock is inside,
and makes up. Before a [room](/room "wikilink") can be built, a
[Construction Worker](/Construction_Worker "wikilink") must blast
through the unmined rock, before starting the construction of your
[room](/room "wikilink").
