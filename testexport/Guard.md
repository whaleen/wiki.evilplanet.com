Well, maybe not the coolest guys in the whole game, but damn useful ones
nevertheless. Guards, as you might expect, are the first real minion
type you will come across that can actually provide some really useful
defence when your base comes under attack. With the ability to wield
slightly better weapons than Construction Workers, they can be deadly
when they work together.

Guards don't do much apart from walk around looking tough, but will help
out with staffing rooms like other minions during quiet times. They are
also useful minions when it comes to raising cash away from your island.
