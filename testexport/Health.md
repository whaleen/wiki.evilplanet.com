Health Stat
-----------

Health is one of the five [stats](/stats "wikilink") that are assigned
to every character in the game. [Agents](/Agents "wikilink"),
[minions](/minions "wikilink"), [evil
geniuses](/Evil_Geniuses "wikilink"), [Super
Agents](/Super_Agents "wikilink") and [henchmen](/Henchmen "wikilink")
all have health stats of varying levels which you should keep an eye on.

### Minions and Agents

When a character's health stat reaches zero, they will be unable to
continue. Different characters respond do a loss of health points
differently. When an [agent](/Agents "wikilink") or a
[minion](/minions "wikilink") loses health points, whether through
combat, being caught in [traps](/traps "wikilink") or certain of the
[torture devices](/torture "wikilink"), they will die.
[Agents](/Agents "wikilink") will turn into a
[bodybag](/bodybag "wikilink") (which generates [heat](/heat "wikilink")
and has an aura which lowers some of the other
[stats](/stats "wikilink")). Being the disposable fools that they are,
[minions](/minions "wikilink") that die simply fade away, and do not
become bodybags.

### Henchmen

Your [Henchmen](/Henchmen "wikilink") respond differently to losing
their health points. When a [henchman's](/henchmen "wikilink") Health
stat falls to zero in combat against normal
[Agents](/Agents "wikilink"), they will not die. Instead, they will lie
on the ground unconscious until a [minion](/minions "wikilink")
retrieves them and places them in the [barracks](/barracks "wikilink").
Here they will regain consciousness and will suffer no further
ill-effects. The only time this is not true is when a
[henchman's](/henchmen "wikilink") Health stat drops in combat against a
[Super Agent](/Super_Agents "wikilink"). If this occurs, the
[henchman](/henchmen "wikilink") will lose one of his or her three
irreplaceable 'lives'. Once all three are lost in combat against [Super
Agent](/Super_Agents "wikilink"), the [henchman](/henchmen "wikilink")
will be dead forever.

### Super Agents

[Super Agents](/Super_Agents "wikilink") cannot die like any of the
other characters. Similar to [henchmen](/henchmen "wikilink"), losing
all of their Health stat causes them to fall unconscious. After a short
period of time, they will rise and begin causing havoc all over again.
The only way to permanently remove a [Super
Agent](/Super_Agents "wikilink") from the game is to complete certain
[objectives](/Objectives "wikilink") that become available at certain
stages of the game.

### Evil Geniuses

[Evil Geniuses](/Evil_Geniuses "wikilink") also have a Health stat, but
when this is lost, the game will end. You will then have to resume the
game from your last saved position.

### Recovering Health

[Minions](/Minions "wikilink") can regain lost health points by visiting
the [Infirmary](/Infirmary "wikilink"). Certain items, such as the
[Infirmary Chair](/Infirmary_Chair "wikilink"), will restore a minion to
full Health. [Evil Geniuses](/Evil_Geniuses "wikilink") can regain
Health points by sitting in their chair in their [Inner
Sanctum](/Inner_Sanctum "wikilink").
