Research allows you to develop new [items](/items "wikilink") and
[traps](/traps "wikilink") to adorn your lair with. Research can only be
conducted by Science [minions](/minions "wikilink") such as the
[technician](/technician "wikilink") and the
[biochemist](/biochemist "wikilink"). Research is conducted in a
[laboratory](/laboratory "wikilink").

Research Process
----------------

Before you can begin research on something your science minions must
find objects they can do research on. These objects can be regular
[items](/items "wikilink") or peices of [loot](/loot "wikilink"). After
your science minions have documented this item in the
[databank](/databank "wikilink") you must select the research apparatus
(up to three) you want to perform tests on. Once you have done that your
scientists will begin research. If it is successful you can now purchase
the item the research has unlocked. If not, well, try again.
